					Different Kinds Of Security Breaches
	This paper is talking about four kinds of threats to the secutity of computing system,include interruption,interception,modification,and fabrication.The four threats all exploit vulnerabilities of the assets in computing systems.
	Interruption:an asset of the system is lost,such as malicious destruction of a hardware device,erasure of a program or data file and system can't find a particular disk file.
	Interceprion:some unauthorized party has gained access to an asset.example is illicit copying of program or data files,or a computing system.
	Modification:an unauthorized party not only accesses but tampers with an asset
	Fabrication:unauthorized party might fabricate counterfeit objects for a computing system.
	The result of the study showed that the four kinds of interference with computer can describe the kinds of exposures possible
